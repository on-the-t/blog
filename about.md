The sabermetric revolution popularized by _Moneyball_ forever changed the way we experience and appreciate America's pasttime. 

Over the past decade, the other major professional team sports have begun to invest more and more resources into analytics. More high-quality data, like Sports VU, is being collected. And more statisticians have been put into full-time positions to help team managers get the most insight from these data. Almost over night, metrics like WAR and Real +/- have become common parlance of sports commentators and fans. Analytics have entered the sports arena and forever changed the way we think about our favorite games. 

While the revolution in statistical thinking in sports has taken off like Usain Bolt for some sports, it has been slow-going for others. Tennis is one example where innovation in analytics has been limited. Match summaries provided by broadcasters are still limited to simple counts. And more sophisticiated analysis have been laughed at by savvy consumers of sports statistics for being useless.

Tennis is in need of analytics revolution. _On the T_ aims to contribute to that goal by presenting stories about tennis that combine visualizations, statistics, and data to gain insight into the game and have some fun along the way.

The sabermetric revolution popularized by _Moneyball_ forever changed the way we experience and appreciate America's pastime, and the world's sports have taken notice.

Over the past decade, the other major professional team sports have begun to follow the MLB's lead. Every day teams are investing more in high-quality data and analysts are becoming an increasingly essential part of a club's talent.

By now, the effects of this change have spread through the sports media. Almost over night, metrics like [WAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement) and [RPM](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10740818/introducing-real-plus-minus) have become common parlance of sports commentators and fans. And the quant-heavy storytelling of sites like [fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com) and [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) are helping to make statistical thinking in sports cool. 

Yet, in the midst of this analytic boom in sports, tennis is getting left behind. The stats that are used today to summarize player performance are the same simple counts and percentages that have been used since the men's professional tour began more than 30 years ago. Few sophisticiated takes on tennis performance exist, and those that do have been so poorly designed that they have been the [subject of ridicule](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/hang_up_and_listen/2015/02/super_bowl_49_hang_up_and_listen_on_pete_carroll_s_play_call_and_the_game.html) of sports journalists. 

Tennis is in need of analytics revolution. _On the T_ was created in response to that need. The mission of _On the T_ is to use data, visualizations, and statistics to gain insight into and celebrate the sport of tennis.

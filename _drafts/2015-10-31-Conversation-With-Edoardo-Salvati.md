title: The Future of Tennis Data&mdash;A Conversation with Edoardo Salvati
comments: true

Earlier this week, _FiveThirtyEight_ writer Oliver Roeder published an article entitled ["Can An Astrophysicist Change The Way We Watch Sports?"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-an-astrophysicist-change-the-way-we-watch-sports/) The piece documents the efforts of Matt Ginsberg (the astrophysicist in question) to develop a system for real-time predictions of shot-making for the NBA and, at the same time, raises a number of broad questions about the future of advanced analytics in sports and sports broadcasting. One of the questions that most intrigued me is whether, as the title of the article suggests, any _one_ person can "revolutionize" how we experience sports?

The idea of one individual single-handedly (or perhaps with the aid of a programming whiz of a son and the financial backing of a dealmaking tycoon) advancing the science of sport has its romantic appeal. But, when it comes to improving the quality and richness of information about sport, I suspect that crowds will make the real breakthroughs&mdash;just as they have with creating a free online [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds), digitizing text, or [translating the Web](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/3/146255-gaining-wisdom-from-crowds/fulltext). 

Consider tennis and the problem of stroke-by-stroke data (i.e. every forehand, slice, etc. and the sequence they were played). Despite a global audience tuning in to every professional tennis match these days, until a few years ago, there was no public data source with information about the strokes played in any professional tennis match. And if we think about how this information could be gathered and made available to the public in a routine way, one could imagine that some genius could one day teach a machine to read "overheads" and "winners" off of a video recording of a match and that said genius wouldn't sell this machine to the highest bidder. Until that day comes, a collaborative effort will be needed.

The [Match Charting Project](http://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2013/11/26/the-match-charting-project/) (MCP) is the most successful effort of this kind. Established around 2012 by Jeff Sackmann, creator of [Tennis Abstract](http://tennisabstract.com/) and [Heavy Topspin](http://heavytopspin.com/), the MCP enlists volunteers to become "citizen scorers" for every stroke in professional tennis matches of their choosing. Sackmann provides volunteers with an Excel spreadsheet to assist with charting in a standardized way and pushes new matches to a [Github repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject) where anyone can access them. 

A little more than one month ago, the MCP could boast 1,100 charted matches by 57 different contributors. When I did a [brief analysis](http://on-the-t.com/2015/09/19/Charting-Match-Charting/) of the distribution of charted matches across contributors, I found a very skewed distribution with a handful of contributors accounting for 20+ matches and the large majority only a few. This made me curious about who the "super"-contributors are and what their motivations to chart and their charting processes tell us about the future of the MCP and similar efforts.

As luck would have it, I recently became acquainted with Edoardo (Edo) Salvati, an MCP super-contributor. Edo is a native of Rome, Italy a world traveler and mountaineer, with training in Business Administration. He is currently doing business development for a boutique law firm, while developing a blog on sports. Recently, Edo was kind enough to answer some questions about the story behind his involvement with the MCP. Below is a transcript of that conversation.

<b>Q1.  How did you get interested in tennis?</b>

_Italy is a soccer dictatorship, with a following that too often resembles a scary religious integralism. When I was growing up, I was looking for a sport that could provide a more intimate and less brutal experience (both by playing it and watching on tv) and would also be closer to my character. Tennis came naturally, with its fair play, quiet and sportsmanship. My first vivid memory is Stefan Edberg’s Wimbledon semifinal loss to Michael Stich in 1991, when he lost the match without dropping serve, I guess also my first taste of a statistical oddity. Then I remember reading about Sampras loss to Federer at Wimbledon in 2001 and thinking ‘how could Sampras lose to an unknown Swiss guy at Wimbledon?!?’. Or – before the internet and at the beginning of the subscription only satellite tv era – trying to watch the 1992 US Open final on the black and white and gray fluttering of a tv screen (like the one you had in old tv sets with bad reception) because I was living with my family and we didn’t have a subscription and it was a thin enough fluttering to allow seeing what was going on behind it. I know, crazy! I was so pleased when Federer and Edberg, my two all-time favorite players, started working together. I hope they can win a Slam one day as a player-coach combination._ 

<b>Q2.  What is your current involvement with the sport? Are you a player, fan, commentator, or would you describe your relationship to the sport in some other way?</b>

_I am a sports addict, in general. I need a daily dose of almost any kind of sport in the form of watching it on tv, reading online commentaries, playing it whenever I can. As for tennis, I am a long-time fan and it is my favorite sport, I can play at a quite good amateur level (but back issues are limiting my desire to play). I have recently started writing about it and one of my piece was published on an Italian sports quarterly magazine website [link?]._

<b>Q3. Which tours do you follow?</b>

_Men’s (Slams, ATP, Davis Cup occasionally). I don’t normally watch women’s matches unless it’s a big matchup or one that could potentially be a landmark, as I don’t derive the same amount of beneficial utility [entertainment value?] as from the men’s game. But I check for WTA results every now and then for updates._

<b>Q4. How do you follow what is happening in the sport? In other words, which tennis media, commentators, or players are your main sources of info about the game?</b>

_I rely on two main sources: the internet and the tv channels. I read articles on American/English websites (ESPN, Grantland, Fivethirtyeight, Heavytopspin, etc), on Slams/ATP/WTA/Tournaments websites, and on any other source that I find through cross-reference links. There are a few tennis websites in Italian worth reading too. I don’t directly follow the players’ Facebook/Twitter accounts. There are three tv channels regularly broadcasting tennis matches in Italy: Supertennis tv – owned by the Italian tennis federation – which has rights to several ATP 500s, WTA premiers/international events and Davis Cup ties and occasionally shows old matches (including Slam matches); Sky Sport tv which has rights to Wimbledon and ATP 1000s; Eurosport (a sort of European ESPN, where Mats Wilander commentates) which has rights to the other 3 Slams and some ATP 250s and WTA international events._

<b>Q5. You have expressed some criticism about some kinds of tennis writing (or perhaps views of fans?). Could you describe what you think are problems with the current state of tennis media?</b>

_Overall, the Italian landscape lacks a statistical approach to tennis analysis. Stats are seen as numbers to throw here and there more for anecdotal reasons than for a real purpose or, worse, as something good only for American sports. There are a couple of websites on which well-written commentary articles can be found, but, in general, there is no dedication to stats. This is also due to an audience that, even for a niche sport like tennis, is not educated to stats and is more interested in a bar-room chitchat type of debate. It should take a serious cultural effort from both sides to give way to a systematic change, which I hardly foresee. Just to give an example, some days ago, the Financial Times published a [one-to-one interview](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/efaeed40-725c-11e5-bdb1-e6e4767162cc.html) with Novak Djokovic on its website. The most important financial newspaper in Italy, which also has a sport section, had it translated by one of their translators who had no clue about tennis. The final result was ridden with gross tennis-related mistakes, which made for a poor reading by any standard._

<b>Q6. When and how did you first learn about Heavy Topspin/Tennis Abstract?</b>

_At the beginning of 2015. I was gathering information about the main US sports media outlets on internet and I read a tennis article by Carl Bialik with FiveThirtyEight, quoting Jeff Sackmann (JS) and his project/blog._


<b>Q7. How did you end up getting involved with the Match Charting Project?</b>

_I congratulated JS by email and asked if there was a way to know a player’s record with a specific umpire (say, Roger Federer w/l record with Pascal Maria). We had a nice tennis opinions exchange. I promised that I would have a look at the charting file and try it out whenever I had the chance._

<b>Q8. What motivated you to participate?</b>

_I was impressed by JS’s work, which makes the occasional article on the ATP website with some numbers in it (they can’t really be called stats) look like a joke. And his talk at the [Sloan conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=15758), which I knew of from reading about it on ESPN/Grantland, gave a further indication that the whole project was a benchmark. Plus, it’s an independent project, which is even more admirable. Also, the database is a very quick and powerful search engine for anything related to a player’s career or performance, so I felt as a tennis fan that I had to give my contribution._

<b>Q9. Have you ever scored before? Or been involved with another effort like this?</b>

_I have never been involved in a similar project, also because I am not aware of other projects like the MCP in tennis._

<b>Q10. How did you learn to chart?</b>

_It has been a learning-by-doing experience. I downloaded the spreadsheet, carefully read the instruction worksheet and started right off. My first match was the 2015 Monte Carlo Masters semifinal between Djokovic and Nadal, which obviously took very long to chart also because a left-hand player makes it more complicated. I had to alternate between typing, pressing the pause button on the remote control and flipping through the instructions print-out to be sure I had the right code, sometimes more than once for the same point. I also happened to having to start back again, especially in long rallies, because I made a mistake or missed a shot. It’s a modus operandi I’m still using today, but having memorized the code I can chart faster. I compare it to learning a language: the more you practice, the more confidence you possess. It can be frustrating in the beginning, but it becomes rewarding in the long-term._

> I compare it to learning a language: the more you practice, the more confidence you possess.

<b>Q11. How do you decide which matches to chart?</b>

_Basically, it is a top-down approach, as it all depends on what matches I can record. Having a complete recorded match is not always possible since the tv guide, which recording is linked to, is often unreliable. If I have several recorded matches available, then I decide according to who’s playing, the length or importance of the match, and its overall appeal. I have a preference for charting men's matches, Slam finals or Tour finals. But I can also chart a 250 R32 which, normally, is less challenging._

<b>Q12. What is the experience of charting like? Do you do anything in particular to prepare? Do you use Jeff Sackmann’s spreadsheet, the Android app, or something else? </b>

_If you are a tennis fan or player, and being either one helps, charting makes you experience a match to a different level of understanding. Rallies become trajectories, the court is a landing spot divided in sectors, shots aren’t just the effect of Newton’s third law of motion, but are defined by where and how they are hit. You get to really appreciate the kinetic beauty of a synchronized dualism. The spreadsheet becomes a living object, pretty much like the screen filled with green, cascading code in “The Matrix”. The code itself reminds me of the chess notation._

_Charting requires time, that is undisputed. The more points played, the longer it takes. But then, when you’re done charting matches like the 2015 French Open final or the 2015 US Open final, you feel you have accomplished something._ 

_I don’t do anything in particular to prepare. I try to find a moment of the day when I know I won’t be interrupted (usually at night), I check if the match I am going to chart is complete, I open the spreadsheet on my laptop and with the remote control in my left hand I type on the keyboard with my right hand._

<b>Q13. Do you chart live matches or only recorded ones?</b>

_I only chart tv recorded matches. Live rallies are played too fast for me to input all the information required for a complete charting. I don’t know if any contributor is live-charting, but it appears that they are all charting recorded matches, except for JS himself as I know he can chart live._

<b>Q14. What happens after you have charted a match?</b>

_I send the spreadsheet to JS and it gets uploaded in the MCP database, where it displays a wide range of detailed data about the match made available to anyone on the TA website. Of course, he is the one dealing with transforming the data collection into end-user stats, which is the value added of this part of the project._

<b>Q15. How many matches have you charted? How many have you attempted to chart?</b>

_At the time of writing, I have charted 73 matches. After having charted two matches that had already been charted, I now make sure to check the database first and “claim” a match on the MCP sheet that lists the matches that are being charted (to avoid duplicating the contributors work). I have never only attempted to chart a match. After having established myself among the top contributors by number of matches, I am now more interested in the quality of the matches I chart, rather than becoming the number 1 contributor (Lowell, currently the one with more logged matches except for JS, has almost 100 matches more than I do). Also, I am quite happy with my contribution, considering it hasn't been that long since I started. After the first match, I thought that I’d never get to double digit matches._

<b>Q16. If you have ever started charting and not finished, what was the reason why?</b>

_I recently started charting the 2009 Rome Masters semifinal between Federer and Djokovic but had to stop after a few games because the recording was corrupted and too many points were missing. I am not aware in advance of issues with the quality of the video unless fast forwarding through every single point, which is a long process and makes little sense. But that was the first and, let’s hope, only time._

<b>Q17. What is difficult about charting? Are there ways charting could be made easier?</b>

_Once you have familiarized with the code, the input is immediate. What I still find tricky is deciding which letter/number to assign to a specific shot. Some shots can land in a part of the court that is exactly in between the set of letters/numbers provided by the code. Apparently similar shots can have a different coding within the same point, because, on a closer look, the ball ends up going in a slightly different direction. Another major decision is making a distinction between forced and unforced errors, which is a known problem in tennis anyway. Also, the observation of shots type, direction and length can be affected by factors like tv cameras angle or position, quality of the video, replays or commercial breaks, which sometimes can be annoying or disrupt the charting. However, the code is exhaustive for the purpose of the data collection and the spreadsheet is self-populating so that you can focus on charting. The ‘having to make a decision’ part could be made easier by adding additional set of letters/numbers, but then the overall input process would become too burdensome and redundant. I think it is a well-balanced tool._

<b>Q18. What are some questions you hope the MCP can help to answer?</b>

_I am not a statistician nor a stats hyper-fanatic, but I can see a big role for stats in interpreting a match, understanding trends, providing a source for analysis, helping finding ‘law and order’ in tennis. The MCP is unique because it is a point-by-point tracking software, so the range of analysis is wide, as testified by JS’s posts on his blog._

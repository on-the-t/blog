title: Kyrgios' AO 2017&mdash; It all came down to work

The last match of Hisense Arena for Day 3 was a disappointing one for the home crowd. Nick Kyrgios faced off against Andreas Seppi, in a rematch of their 2015 Australian Open meeting. Kyrgios won the previous meeting in a close five sets. This year it was a different story.

Despite appearing to run away with the match in the first two sets, Kyrgios seemed to lose his will in the 3rd and 4th. It was clear to the fans watching that he was struggling physically and his head wasn't simply in it. 

_But how can we really talk about Kyrgios' struggles?_ Although we can never know what kind of physical and mental issues player's a struggling with, we are able to measure the side effects of these processed better today than ever before.

One of the metrics I've developed in my role with GIG is a measure of physical work. It primarily focuses on the lower body work (as it is still a challenge to capture upper body movement from current tracking data) but even that has already given us a number of insights into performance and how some players' efforts separate themselves from others on tour.

If we look at the work breakdown for the 2015 and 2017 Kygrios v Seppi matches, it paints a fascinating picture. Both Seppi and Kyrgios had to work harder in 2015 overall, suggesting that Kyrgios' speedy play this year affected the effort of both players. Interesting that in both matches, Kyrgios had resurgences of effor in the 2nd and 5th sets. But the overall lower output made the difference for the outcome this year.

Another area where we can get a sense of a player's state of mind is in the way they pace themselves in preparing to serve. We all know Kyrgios likes to play fast but even he can vary over the course of a match. The pace time for both Seppi and Kyrgios increased in the final two sets, suggesting that they were slowing down to focus more on getting to the win. Last night, Kyrgios's average pace dropped 3 seconds in the 3rd set and again in the 4th. 

These numbers suggest that Kyrgios wanted the match to simply be over. However, he seemed to change his mindset in the final set, raising his pace back to 17 seconds, a more typical one for his style of play. But it wasn't enough to recover the win this year.

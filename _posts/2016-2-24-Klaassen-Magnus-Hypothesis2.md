title: Klaassen & Magnus's 22 Myths of Tennis&mdash; Myth 2

The second myth addressed in Klaassen and Magnus's instant classic of tennis analysis, [Analyzing Wimbledon](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/analyzing-wimbledon-9780199355952?cc=us&lang=en&#), is the myth of serving first in a match.

## Myth 1: "Is there an advantage to serve first in a set?"

The coin toss is one of those pre-match rituals that many of us fast-forward through. But if you can recall any occasion when you have stopped to watch the coin toss, there is a very good chance that the player who won the toss opted to serve. Players generally prefer to serve first because there is a general belief that serving first gives a player an edge. Why would that be? 

There are a variety of explanations, all psychological in nature. Some say that players are fresh in the first game, making holding serve even more certain. Others say the benefit of playing from a clean slate increases effectiveness on serve. Then, once a player is ahead in the game (however it happens), this adds confidence that makes it that much easier to close out the set. And so on... 

Is there evidence that players benefit from serving first in a set?

## Conclusions of Klaassen and Magnus

Tennis juggernauts Klaassen and Magnus evaluated Myth 2 (there stated favorite) with data from Wimbledon and found that players were more likely to win the first set if they served first but were more likely to lose any other set if they served first. This paradox is explained by the fact that the player who serves first is a random event determined by the coin toss, whereas the player who serves first in any other set is tied to the winner of the previous set and how they won. After the first set, the loser of the last set will serve first if the set winner won on serve (which is the usually way player's win the set). This makes serving first in any set other than the first highly correlated with the skill of the serving player. 

When the quality is controlled, Klaassen and Magnus show that the advantage to serving disappears. This has been replicated by analysis by IBM and Heavy Topspin??

That still leaves the first set, where serving first is not correlated with player quality. In this case, K&M conclude that there is a slight advantage to serving first. Why? Because they find that players are more effective in winning points in the first game, by 3 or 4%. 

I was baffled when I first read this and kept expecting the "But when we looked at..." that so often appears in Klaassen and Magnus's work at a moment of puzzlement to clarify an otherwise bewildering result. Yet it never came. 

So I went about replicating this finding to see if 1) it was real and 2) if so, what could be the cause?

## Revisiting the Advantage of Serving in the First Game

Using 2,000 randomly selected ATP matches and an equal number of randomly chosen WTA matches from the past five years, I contrasted the probability of winning a point in the first game for the serving player to all other games. Counter to Klaassen and Magnus's finding of a 3-4 percentage point increase in winning points on serve in the first game, I found no significant serve advantage in the first game for either tours.

To try to understand the different result, I plotted the average points won on serve by the game order. Figure 1 shows the pattern for the ATP, Figure 2 for the WTA. This reveals a few interesting patterns.
